    "I am a freelance consultant, advising small businesses. One customer, active in the fitness sector, contacted me with the following idea:\n",
    "Due to the current Corona (Covid-19) crisis he expects that several restaurants will go bankrupt; especially bad restaurants. He wants to take advantage of this situation and cheaply take over one restaurant and convert it into a gym. He already owns several gyms, but wants to expand into New York with a first gym, in the center of Manhattan - where cheap locations are hard to find. Of course the new gym has to be at a location, where no other gym is located in the close area.\n",
    "My client asks to provide him a list with bad restaurants in the center of Manhattan, where no gym is located in the close area.\n",

    "## Data Source\n",
    "The problem will be solved as follows: 1 - Define the center of Manhattan (e.g. time square) and get the location data of the center from Foursquare. 2 - Find all restaurants in the wider area of the center (e.g. 5 miles); get the rating of all restaurants, and only select restaurants with a bad rating (e.g. rating lower than 10% percentile). Venues (Restaurants) and Ratings are available in Foursquare. 3 - Drop all restaurants that have a gym in the close area (e.g. within 0.5 miles). Gyms and their geographical locations are available in Foursquare."
